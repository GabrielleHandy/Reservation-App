>>> Hey! Welcome to Melon Reservations! <<<

I used sql/psql for my database.
python and flask on the backend and javascript on the front


A challenge I came across was learning how to manipulate and compare time. I used the python datetime module to format and found that datetime.time objects can be compared so I used that in order to find a range of times.. 

If I had more time I would have styled more, and added testing. I also wanted to add a way to remove and edit reservations.
